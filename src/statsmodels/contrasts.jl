"""
Interface to describe contrast coding schemes for categorical variables.

Concrete subtypes of `AbstractContrasts` describe a particular way of converting a
categorical data vector into numeric columns in a `ModelMatrix`. Each
instantiation optionally includes the levels to generate columns for and the base
level. If not specified these will be taken from the data when a `ContrastsMatrix` is
generated (during `ModelFrame` construction).

# Constructors

For `C <: AbstractContrast`:

```julia
C()                                     # levels are inferred later 
C(levels = ::Vector{Any})               # levels checked against data later
C(base = ::Any)                         # specify base level
C(levels = ::Vector{Any}, base = ::Any) # specify levels and base
```

If specified, levels will be checked against data when generating a
`ContrastsMatrix`. Any mismatch will result in an error, because missing data
levels would lead to empty columns in the model matrix, and missing contrast
levels would lead to empty or undefined rows.

You can also specify the base level of the contrasts. The
actual interpretation of this depends on the particular contrast type, but in
general it can be thought of as a "reference" level.  It defaults to the first
level.

Both `levels` and `base` will be coerced to the type of the data when
constructing a `ContrastsMatrix`.

# Concrete types

* `TreatmentContrasts`
* `SumContrasts`
* `HelmertContrasts`

To implement your own concrete types, implement a constructor and a
`contrast_matrix` method for constructing the actual contrasts matrix
that maps from levels to `ModelMatrix` column values:

```julia
type MyContrasts <: AbstractContrasts
    ...
end

contrasts_matrix(C::MyContrasts, baseind, n) = ...
```

`~0+x` vs. `~1+x`, or in the interactions terms in `~1+x+x&y` vs. `~1+x+y+x&y`. In the
non-redundant cases, we can expand x into `length(levels(x))` columns
without creating a non-identifiable model matrix (unless the user has done
something foolish in specifying the model, which we can't do much about anyway).

    SumContrasts

Column for level `x` of column `col` is 1 where `col .== x` and -1 where
`col .== base`.

Produces mean-0 (centered) columns _only_ when all levels are equally frequent.
But with more than two levels, the generated columns are guaranteed to be non-
orthogonal (so beware of collinearity).

    HelmertContrasts

Produces contrast columns with -1 for each of n levels below contrast, n for
contrast level, and 0 above.  Produces something like:

```
[-1 -1 -1
  1 -1 -1
  0  2 -1
  0  0  3]
```

This is a good choice when you have more than two levels that are equally frequent.
Interpretation is that the nth contrast column is the difference between
level n+1 and the average of levels 1 to n.  When balanced, it has the
nice property of each column in the resulting model matrix being orthogonal and
with mean 0.
